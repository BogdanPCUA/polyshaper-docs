Once you've installed Polyshaper, the first thing is to import the image you want to work with.

## Import an Image

Just drag the image over the app, or click anywhere on the screen to pick one from tour filesystem.

Note that until you have at least 3 points any shape will be displayed.

If you are not convinced with some of the points you can get rid of them.
Just select the **Eraser Tool** and drag the mouse over them.
