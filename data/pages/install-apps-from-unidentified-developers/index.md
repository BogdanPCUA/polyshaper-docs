If you've never installed Applications from outside the App Store, you will not be able to install Polyshaper until you authorize installation of apps from unidentified developers.

Just follow the steps on this [guide](https://kb.wisc.edu/helpdesk/page.php?id=25443). And then try to install Polyshaper again.

If you have any problem, please contact to [info@polyshaper.co](mailto:info@polyshaper.co).
